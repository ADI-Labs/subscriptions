club logins
make each club an account, manually choose what club they're tied to
flask login

plan was to choose 10-20 clubs to access, approve them
backend - identify who sent message
one account per club

everytime send message, log the message (info-time/text)

*manually* give them accounts


users will subscribe through lionbot
manaully approve them as member, but still register as you did (hold on priveleges)
